## Dataset
The dataset that we used is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of two classes: defective and good. There are 1028 images of defective tires and 828 images of good tires in the dataset.

However, the dataset we acquired has varied sizes. Therefore, we conducted preprocessing by resizing the images to 512x512. Additionally, we divided our dataset into training and testing sets. For the training set, we utilized 822 images of defective tires and 622 images of good tires. Meanwhile, for the testing set, we needed 206 images of defective tires and 166 images of good tires. Consequently, the total number of images we used amounts to 1856.

Moreover, we implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality of our dataset. We applied vertical and horizontal flips, 90-degree rotation, and Gaussian blur during the augmentation process.
